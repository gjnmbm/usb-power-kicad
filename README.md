# usb-power-kicad
A KiCAD project that would allow one to provide external power to USB devices via a power jack using USB 3.0.

## Note: 

CAM files reflect revision 2 of this board, so if you want to use CAM files when ordering a PCB, you will need to export the current revision of this board into the files you need.

The footprint I used from Ultra Librarian was wrong for the female USB 3.0 A connector, so I had to make changes to it following what the datasheet said.
The footprint I edited has hopefully been added to this repository.
